I joined Race to a Cure near its formation as one of the sole graphic designers. I worked overtime to kickstart the organization, creating logos, banners, color schemes, everything you can think of. I actively contributed and watched as my efforts led to results, which led to my promotion to Social Lead, where I lead a department of 30 people. During my time there, I was able to grow our follower base from 100 to 7000, and gain proficient graphic design skills. I also gained strong research capabilities through a research study on the availability of medical resources, testing/reporting cases, and chronic illness during the Covid-19 pandemic. "

In particular, I helped out with the 'CtrlGen: Controllable Generative Modelling in Language and Vision workshop', managing the chat and keeping engagement going. It taught me a lot about the limitations of machine learning models, and cool projects such as bots trained to play hide and seek virtually. This helped me a lot in developing my own machine-learning model for detecting toxicity on Discord."
